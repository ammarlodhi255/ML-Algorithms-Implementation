    HOW DOES KNN WORK?

    Given a data point,
    1. Calculate the distance between the data point and all other data points in the dataset,
    2. Choose the K closest points,

    3. THEN,
    In case of regression: Take the average of the closest K values and assign it to the data point.
    In case of classification: Take the majority vote and assign that class to the data point.
